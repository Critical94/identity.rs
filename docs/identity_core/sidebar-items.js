The Diff trait gives data structures an ability to compare themselves to another data structure of the same type over time.  The library pairs off with `identity_derive` which implements a derive macro for the `Diff` Trait. Types supported include `HashMap`, `Option`, `String`, `serde_json::Value`, `Vec` and primitives such as `i8`/`u8` up to `usize` and `isize` as well as the unit type `()`, `bool`, and `char` types.  Structs and Enums are supported via `identity_derive` and can be composed of any number of these types."],["error","Errors that may occur when Self-sovereign Identity goes wrong."],["utils","Misc. utility functions."]]});
