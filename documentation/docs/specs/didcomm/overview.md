*version 0.1, last changed September 2021*

TODO: make clear that we only show message payloads in the protocol examples
TODO: come up with a new protocol, `didcomm://` is VERBOTEN https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/#didcomm-message-uris 


## Conformance

The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this specification are to be interpreted as described in

## External Protocols

In addition to the protocols defined in this specification, we recommend implementors use the following well-known protocols:

| Name | Version | Description |
| :--- | :---: | :--- | 
| [Discover Features](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didcomm-messaging/blob/9039564e143380a0085a788b6dfd20e63873b9ca/docs/spec-files/feature_discovery.md) | 1.0 | Describes how agents can query one another to discover which features it supports, and to what extent. |
| [Trust Ping](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didcomm-messaging/blob/9039564e143380a0085a788b6dfd20e63873b9ca/docs/spec-files/trustping.md) | 1.0 | A standard way for agents to test connectivity, responsiveness, and security of a DIDComm channel. |

## Future Work

â—ˆ If necessary, discuss ways for some agent to request the start of an interaction. This has narrow use cases, but might be interesting in the long run.
